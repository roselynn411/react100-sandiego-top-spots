# San Diego Hotspots in React
A small, informational website containing a list of 30 "Top Places to See" in San Diego was built. The purpose of this project was to create the same idea but in React. The website includes a description of the hot spot as well as a link to the locations in google maps.

This project included CSS styling provided by Bootstrap as well as a reference to a JSON file included in the code. In the code, a container component was created to manage the application state as well as a presentational component to render a single top spot.
